# TalkNet Speaker Activity JSON Export

This repository provides a **modified version of `demoTalkNet.py`** that adds a post-processing function to generate a structured **JSON file** with **speaker activity segments** and their estimated **position (left/right)**.

---

## ‚ú® What's New?

I've added a new function called `generate_speaker_activity_json()` which:
- Processes face tracking data and activity scores,
- Identifies when speakers are active,
- Estimates their position (left or right) based on face bounding box centers,
- Saves all detected segments in a clear and structured JSON file.

## üîß How to Use It

You can follow the **exact same installation and inference steps as the original TalkNet repository**, with one simple change:

### ‚úÖ Steps:

1. **Clone TalkNet and SyncNet** as described in the original [TalkNet repository](https://github.com/obss/talknet).
2. **Replace** their original `demoTalkNet.py` script with the one provided here (in this repository).
3. **Run inference** as usual:
   python demoTalkNet.py --video input_video.mp4
4. After inference, a new JSON file will be generated in your output directory, containing speaker activity segments with timestamps and speaker position.
